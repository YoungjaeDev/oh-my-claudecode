| "Fixed async race condition" | "Fixed crash on file upload" |
| "Refactored auth module" | "Improved login speed by 50%" |
| "Updated deps" | "Improved security with latest libraries" |

|------|----------|
| semantic-release | Full CI/CD automation |
| release-please | GitHub PR-based review |
| git-cliff | Customizable generation |
