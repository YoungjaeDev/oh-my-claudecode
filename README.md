**Multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code. Zero learning curve.**

*Some advanced users customize zsh for years — most of us just use oh-my-zsh.*
*Don't learn Claude Code. Just use OMC.*

[Get Started](#get-started) • [Documentation](https://yeachan-heo.github.io/oh-my-claudecode-website) • [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md)

</div>

## Get Started (30 seconds)

**Step 1:** Install the plugin
```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

**Step 2:** Run setup
```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

---

## What Happens Now

| When You... | I Automatically... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Give me a complex task | Parallelize with specialist agents |
| Say "plan this" | Start a planning interview |
| Say "don't stop until done" | Persist until verified complete |
| Work on UI/frontend | Activate design sensibility |
| Need research or exploration | Delegate to specialized agents |
| Say "build me..." or use autopilot | Execute full autonomous workflow |

**You don't need to memorize commands.** I detect intent from natural language and activate the right behaviors automatically.

---

## Magic Keywords (Optional Shortcuts)

These are **optional shortcuts** for power users who want explicit control. Natural language works just fine - these keywords simply provide precision when you want it.

Include these words anywhere in your message:

| Keyword | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `ralph` | Persistence mode - won't stop until done |
| `ralplan` | Iterative planning with consensus |
| `ulw` / `ultrawork` | Maximum parallel execution |
| `ultrapilot` | Parallel autopilot (3-5x faster) |
| `swarm` | N coordinated agents |
| `pipeline` | Sequential agent chaining |
| `eco` / `ecomode` | Token-efficient parallel execution |
| `plan` | Start a planning interview |
| `autopilot` / `ap` | Full autonomous execution |

**Combine them:** `ralph ulw: migrate the database` or `eco: refactor auth system`

---

## Execution Modes (v3.4.0)

### Ultrapilot: Parallel Autopilot

3-5x faster execution with up to 5 parallel workers. Perfect for multi-component systems and large refactoring:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ultrapilot "build a fullstack todo app"
```

**How it works:**
- Automatic task decomposition into parallelizable subtasks
- Non-overlapping file ownership prevents conflicts
- Parallel execution with intelligent coordination
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution

---

### Swarm: Coordinated Agents

N independent agents claiming tasks from a shared pool:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:swarm 5:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

**Features:**
- Atomic task claiming prevents duplicate work
- 5-minute timeout per task with auto-release
- Scales from 2 to 10 workers

---

### Pipeline: Sequential Chaining

Chain agents together with data passing between stages:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:pipeline explore:haiku -> architect:opus -> executor:sonnet
```

**Built-in Presets:**
- `review` - explore → architect → critic → executor
- `implement` - planner → executor → tdd-guide
- `debug` - explore → architect → build-fixer
- `security` - explore → security-reviewer → executor

---

### Ecomode: Token-Efficient

Maximum parallelism with Haiku where possible, falling back to Sonnet/Opus for complex reasoning:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ecomode "refactor the authentication system"
```

**30-50% token savings** compared to standard ultrawork while maintaining quality.

---

## Auto Skill Learning (v3.5.0)

OMC can automatically detect patterns in your problem-solving and suggest extracting them as reusable skills.

### How It Works

1. **Pattern Detection** - Recognizes problem-solution pairs in conversations
2. **Skill Extraction** - `/oh-my-claudecode:learner` extracts reusable knowledge
3. **Auto-Matching** - Fuzzy matching detects when skills apply to new problems
4. **Auto-Invocation** - High-confidence matches (80+) auto-apply without prompting

### Managing Local Skills

```
/oh-my-claudecode:skill list           # List all learned skills
/oh-my-claudecode:skill search "auth"  # Find skills by keyword
/oh-my-claudecode:skill edit <name>    # Edit a skill
/oh-my-claudecode:skill sync           # Sync user + project skills
```

### Skill Storage

- **User-level**: `~/.claude/skills/sisyphus-learned/` (shared across projects)
- **Project-level**: `.omc/skills/` (project-specific)

Skills use YAML frontmatter with triggers, tags, and quality scores.

## Analytics & Cost Tracking (v3.5.0)

Track your Claude Code usage across all sessions with automatic transcript analysis.

### Backfill Historical Data

```
omc backfill                    # Analyze all transcripts
omc backfill --from 2026-01-01  # From specific date
omc backfill --project "*/myproject/*"  # Filter by project
```

### View Statistics

```
omc stats                       # All sessions aggregate
omc stats --session             # Current session only
omc stats --json                # JSON output
```

**Sample Output:**
```
📊 All Sessions Stats
Sessions: 18
Entries: 3356

💰 Token Usage & Cost
Total Tokens: 4.36M
Total Cost: $2620.49

🤖 Top Agents by Cost (All Sessions)
  (main session)              700.7k tokens  $1546.46
  oh-my-claudecode:architect    1.18M tokens  $432.68
  oh-my-claudecode:planner    540.9k tokens  $274.85
  oh-my-claudecode:executor   306.9k tokens  $77.43
```

**Features:**
- Automatic backfill on first `omc stats` run
- Global storage in `~/.omc/state/` (cross-project)
- Proper agent attribution (main session vs spawned agents)
- Deduplication prevents double-counting

## Data Analysis & Research (v3.4.0)

### Scientist Agent Tiers

Three tiers of scientist agents for quantitative analysis and data science:

| Agent | Model | Use For |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `scientist-low` | Haiku | Quick data inspection, simple statistics, file enumeration |
| `scientist` | Sonnet | Standard analysis, pattern detection, visualization |
| `scientist-high` | Opus | Complex reasoning, hypothesis validation, ML workflows |

**Features:**
- **Persistent Python REPL** - Variables persist across calls (no pickle/reload overhead)
- **Structured markers** - `[FINDING]`, `[STAT:*]`, `[DATA]`, `[LIMITATION]` for parsed output
- **Quality gates** - Every finding requires statistical evidence (CI, effect size, p-value)
- **Auto-visualization** - Charts saved to `.omc/scientist/figures/`
- **Report generation** - Markdown reports with embedded figures

```python
# Variables persist across calls!
python_repl(action="execute", researchSessionID="analysis",
            code="import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')")

# df still exists - no need to reload
python_repl(action="execute", researchSessionID="analysis",
            code="print(df.describe())")
```

### /oh-my-claudecode:research Command (NEW)

Orchestrate parallel scientist agents for comprehensive research workflows:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:research <goal>                    # Standard research with checkpoints
/oh-my-claudecode:research AUTO: <goal>              # Fully autonomous until complete
/oh-my-claudecode:research status                    # Check current session
/oh-my-claudecode:research resume                    # Resume interrupted session
/oh-my-claudecode:research list                      # List all sessions
/oh-my-claudecode:research report <session-id>       # Generate report for session
```

**Research Protocol:**
1. **Decomposition** - Breaks goal into 3-7 independent stages
2. **Parallel Execution** - Fires scientist agents concurrently (max 5)
3. **Cross-Validation** - Verifies consistency across findings
4. **Synthesis** - Generates comprehensive markdown report

**Smart Model Routing:**
- Data gathering tasks → `scientist-low` (Haiku)
- Standard analysis → `scientist` (Sonnet)
- Complex reasoning → `scientist-high` (Opus)

**Session Management:** Research state persists at `.omc/research/{session-id}/` enabling resume after interruption.

## Stopping Things

Just say:
- "stop"
- "cancel"
- "abort"

I'll intelligently determine what to stop based on context.

---

## MCP Server Configuration

Extend Claude Code with additional tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

```
/oh-my-claudecode:mcp-setup
```

### Supported MCP Servers

| Server | Description | API Key Required |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Context7** | Documentation and code context from popular libraries | No |
| **Exa** | Enhanced web search (replaces built-in websearch) | Yes |
| **Filesystem** | Extended file system access | No |
| **GitHub** | GitHub API for issues, PRs, repos | Yes (PAT) |

### Quick Setup

Run the setup command and follow the prompts:
```
/oh-my-claudecode:mcp-setup
```

Or configure manually in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After configuration, restart Claude Code for changes to take effect.

---

## HUD Statusline

The HUD displays real-time orchestration status in Claude Code's status bar:

```
[OMC] | 5h:0% wk:100%(1d6h) | ctx:45% | agents:Ae
todos:3/5 (working: Implementing feature)
```

**Line 1:** Core metrics
- Rate limits with reset times (e.g., `wk:100%(1d6h)` = resets in 1 day 6 hours)
- Context window usage
- Active agents (coded by type and model tier)

**Line 2:** Todo progress
- Completion ratio (`3/5`)
- Current task in progress

Run `/oh-my-claudecode:hud setup` to configure display options.

---

## Coming from 2.x?

**Good news:** Your old commands still work!

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ralph "task"      →  Still works (or just say "ralph: task")
/oh-my-claudecode:ultrawork "task"  →  Still works (or just use "ulw" keyword)
/oh-my-claudecode:planner "task"    →  Still works (or just say "plan this")
```

The difference? You don't *need* them anymore. Everything auto-activates.
